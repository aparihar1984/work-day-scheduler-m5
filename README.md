Module 5 Work Day Scheduler Challenge!

Creating a functioning Work Day Calendar.

## Introduction
For this assignment, I created a calendar that allows the user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). The Work Day Calendar features HTML and CSS pages powered by jQuery.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I created a Work Day Calendar using a JavaScript file that featured the following:

When the planner is opened, the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.

When the user scrolls down the Work Day Calendar, they are presented with time blocks for the standard business hours of 9am to 5pm.

When the user views the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (grey), present (red), or future (green).

When the user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event.

When the user clicks the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in a local storage.

## References
To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from both the Module 3-JavaScript and Module 5-Third-Party-APIs Class Files as references:

"07-Ins_Logical-Comparison-Operators" "09-Ins_Event-Delegation" "26-Stu_DayJS-Format"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites:

"https://github.com/comp7589/WorkDayScheduler"
"https://github.com/CailinBellWold/Work-Day-Scheduler"
"https://thecodebarbarian.com/formatting-javascript-dates-with-moment-js.html"
"https://www.webdevolution.com/blog/uncaught-reference-error-moment-is-not-defined"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites and commenting out every section of code in my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to see what each specific block of code accomplished.

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete the assignment.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria. It should also be noted that simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications.
